# TfsCmdlets Release Notes

## Version 2.0.0-beta.15 (_21/Jul/2020_)

This release is mostly the WiX (MSI) installer, which was in need of some long overdue love. This is done in preparation for publishing TfsCmdlets to the **winget** repository.

### Improvements

- Adds custom bitmaps to the MSI installer
- Changes installation scope from machine-wide to user-wide. This way the installation no longer requires admin rights.
- Adds actual license agreement text to the installer (replaces _lorem ipsum_).
