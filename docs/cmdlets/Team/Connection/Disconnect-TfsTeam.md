breadcrumbs: [ "Connection" ]
parent: "Connection"
description: "Disconnects from the currently connected team."
remarks: "The Disconnect-TfsTeam cmdlet removes the connection previously set by its counterpart Connect-TfsTeam. Therefore, cmdlets relying on a \"default team\" as provided by \"Get-TfsTeam -Current\" will no longer work after a call to this cmdlet, unless their -Team argument is provided or a new call to Connect-TfsTeam is made."
